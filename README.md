# Multithreaded-Heat-Equation-Solver

This repository contains a Python program that solves the initial-boundary value problem for the heat equation in a rectangle using the alternating direction implicit (ADI) method. The program utilizes two threads: a main thread for overall program management and a secondary thread for performing computations.

Key features:

路 Multithreading: The program uses two threads for efficient processing.
路 Numerical solution: The program solves the heat equation numerically, using the ADI method.
路 Visualization: After completing the computations, the main thread visualizes the results as 3D graphs.
路 File input: The program reads the initial data from a text file.
